# Why are tuples faster than lists in python
# Tuples are faster than list, due to their immutability

# In which real-world scenario would you prefer a tuple over a list
# 
# When I have to store stock prices then I will use List like below
# 
# StockPrices = [200,300,400,500]
# 
# But when I have to store the purchased stock quantity then I will use tuple like below
# 
# StockQty = (5,10,15)
