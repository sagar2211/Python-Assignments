# What is the range data type in python?
# The Python range type is an immutable sequence of 
# integers used primarily for looping a specific number of times in for loops. 

# How it is different from a list of numbers?
# It is a memory-efficient object because it generates numbers on demand (lazy evaluation) 
# rather than storing all values in memory like a list.
